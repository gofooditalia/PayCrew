### CSS Improvements (`src/app/globals.css`)
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .text-gray-600 { color: rgb(75 85 99) !important; }
  .text-gray-500 { color: rgb(55 65 81) !important; }
  .text-xs { font-size: 0.875rem !important; }
}
```

### Component Updates

## Next Steps for Production

### 1. Automatic Deployment
- Vercel should automatically detect the push and deploy changes
- Monitor deployment status at Vercel dashboard
- Verify deployment completes successfully

### 2. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices (iPhone, Android)

- Gather user feedback on mobile readability

## Rollback Plan

If any issues arise:
1. Revert to previous commit: `git revert 6f11c49`
2. Push revert: `git push origin main`
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy previous version

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
