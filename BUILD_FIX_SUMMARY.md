# Build Fix Summary - Mobile Text Visibility Implementation

## Issue Resolved
During the build process, we encountered a compilation error related to the Tailwind CSS utility class `text-muted-foreground`, which is not a standard Tailwind class.

## Error Message
```
Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class `sm:text-muted-foreground`
```

## Root Cause
The custom utility classes in `src/app/globals.css` were using non-standard Tailwind classes:
- `text-muted-foreground` is not a built-in Tailwind utility
- The `sm:text-muted-foreground` variant was causing the build to fail

## Solution Applied

### Before (Problematic Code)
```css
.mobile-text-muted {
  @apply text-gray-600 sm:text-muted-foreground;
}
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```css
.mobile-text-muted {
  @apply text-gray-600;
}
```

- **Dashboard Route**: 13.2 kB (127 kB First Load JS)
- **All pages compiled successfully**

## Impact of the Fix

### What Changed
1. Removed non-standard Tailwind classes from custom utility classes
2. Maintained mobile text visibility improvements using standard Tailwind classes
3. Ensured build compatibility while preserving the mobile readability fixes

### Mobile Text Visibility Improvements Preserved
- Mobile-specific CSS rules for better contrast (`@media (max-width: 768px)`)
- Custom utility classes for mobile text styling
- Enhanced font sizes and contrast ratios for mobile devices
- All component updates remain intact and functional

## Verification Checklist
